# Gogo Swing

Gogo Swing makes writing Java Swing applications easy. It makes it easy to create forms with input fields.
The widgets in the panels are bound to models from the `gogolib` library. The entered values are set in the models
automatically and changes made to the models are reflected in the widgets automatically.
